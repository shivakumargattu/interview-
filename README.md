 <h1>Tell Me About your Self</h1>
 <p>Thank you for giving me this opportunity. My name is Shivakumar Gattu, and I'm from Gajulapeta in Mahabubnagar district. I completed my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Pallavi Engineering College.

After graduation, I worked as a Business Development Executive at Byju's. Observing the vast opportunities and growth in the IT field, I decided to transition my career into this domain. To upskill myself, I enrolled in NXT Wave, where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Python, and Node.js.

One of the projects I developed is the "Tomato Food Delivery Application." This responsive web application allows users to browse food items, add them to the cart, filter products based on categories, and proceed to checkout. I implemented React Router for seamless navigation across multiple pages and added dynamic add-to-cart functionality with real-time updates to the total amount and items. Additionally, I built product filtering features to allow users to filter food items by category (e.g., veg, non-veg) and integrated login and logout popups with form validation for user authentication. The application features a fully responsive design across devices using custom CSS styling and CSS keyframe animations for smooth UI transitions.

This project helped me gain practical experience in frontend development </p>

#### How do you rate yourself in CSS
I would rate myself as an intermediate in CSS. I'm proficient with basic selectors, flexbox, media queries, and various properties. However, I'm still learning about position utilities, animations, transitions, and certain CSS selectors. I'm committed to expanding my knowledge and improving my skills in these areas.
